    <p>Dear Shivam,</p>

    <p>
      It feels strange and nice at the same time to write this letter to you.
      Can you believe it has already been five years since we last met?
      Sometimes it feels like yesterday, and sometimes it feels like a whole lifetime ago.
    </p>

    <p>
      I still remember that evening in Shivamogga when we randomly decided to walk
      without any destination, just talking about life, plans, and things that made no sense.
      We laughed at the smallest things and complained about the biggest ones,
      thinking we had everything figured out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Life, of course, had other plans. We got busy, cities changed, responsibilities increased,
      and somehow conversations became rare. But even now, whenever I pass a quiet road
      or sit alone with my thoughts, those memories come back without warning.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope you are doing well, staying healthy, and chasing whatever dreams you once told me about.
      Maybe someday we’ll meet again, sit down for a cup of tea,
      and continue those unfinished conversations like no time has passed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Until then, take care of yourself and keep smiling.
    </p>

      Yours sincerely,<br><br>
      Srijee
