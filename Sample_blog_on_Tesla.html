    <h3>Nikola Tesla – The Man Who Lit the World</h3>

        <h4>About Nikola Tesla</h4>
        <p>
            Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor and electrical engineer who basically changed the way the modern world uses electricity. Born in 1856 in what is now Croatia, Tesla showed early signs of brilliance — the kind of guy who could visualize entire machines in his head before even building them. His biggest contribution? Developing the alternating current (AC) system of electricity, which is still used worldwide today. At a time when many supported direct current (DC), Tesla’s AC system proved more efficient for transmitting electricity over long distances, and it eventually won the famous “War of Currents.” </p>

           <p>Tesla worked briefly with Thomas Edison but their relationship didn’t last long due to major disagreements over electrical systems. Later, Tesla partnered with George Westinghouse to promote AC power, and together they helped power the world — including the famous Niagara Falls power project. Beyond electricity, Tesla experimented with wireless communication, radio waves, robotics, and even concepts that inspired modern Wi-Fi and remote control. The dude was literally thinking 100 years ahead of his time.</p> 

          <p> Even though he was a genius, Tesla struggled financially and died in 1943 with little recognition compared to others of his era. But today? He’s seen as one of the greatest inventors ever. From electric cars named after him to global tech admiration, Tesla’s legacy is massive. He wasn’t just an inventor — he was a visionary who imagined a future powered by innovation and limitless energy. 🔥</p>
