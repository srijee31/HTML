<h1> PERFECT</h1>
<body>
    <p>I found a love for me <br>
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead <br>
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet <br>
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin′ for me<br>
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowin′ what it was<br>
I will not give you up this time<br>
Oh, darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own<br>
And in your eyes, you're holding mine <br>          
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms<br>
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song<br>   
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath<br>
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
Well, I found a woman   stronger than anyone I know<br>
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br>
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets<br>          
To carry love, to carry children of our own<br>
We are still kids, but we're so in love, fighting against all odds<br>
I know we'll be alright this time<br>
Darling, just
